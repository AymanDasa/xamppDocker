# Services
## apache

This service uses the official php 8.0.28-apache image and sets the working directory to C:\project\webhost\php\html. 
- It also maps the local C:\project\webhost\php\html  directory to /var/www/html inside the container.


## db

This service uses the official MariaDB image and sets the root password to "password". 
- It also creates a database called mydata, and a user called admin with the password "password". 
- This service maps port 9906 to 3306 and is part of the dev-env network.


## phpmyadmin

This service uses the official phpMyAdmin image and sets the document root to /app. 
- It also depends on the mariadb service and maps port 8080 to port 80.
